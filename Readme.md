# Final project assignment
**Computational Visual Design Lab ([CVDLab](https://github.com/cvd-lab))**  
**DIA, "Roma Tre" University, Rome, Italy**  
**Computational Graphics 2013**  

## Introduction

The project is individual and mandatory. The exam cannot be sustained without an individual project, which must be delivered at least two days before the registration.
Each student is free to choose the topic of the individual project within the general themes discussed below, but no two subjects may coincide.
The structure and the graphic refinement of the web pages will contribute to the project evaluation, together with the quality of the produced javascript/python code, and with the visual quality of the details implemented in the project.

## General requirements

Each student project must choose some appropriate techniques of shape generation/reconstruction for each modeled object or part of it, and describe it synthetically in English. 
The project will be illustrated by a set of web pages hosted/linked within the student account on [github](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/), using the standard CSS stylesheets offered by this site.
The sources of images, information or data must be documented or linked within the project's web site.
The images or thumbnails of the generated models must embed a link to the Javascript executable code, written using the package [Plasm.js](http://cvdlab.github.io/plasm.js/), as learned during the [Computational Graphics](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/) course.
Prototypes of the shape should be developed by using the  python module [Pyplasm](www.plasm.net), with sources linked from the relative images.


### Models of Italian design

The theme concerns the geometric modeling of some (at least two) appealing and representative examples of Italian design of the XX century, choosing from interior, industrial, automotive, or fashion design (see the article [Italian design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_design) from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, and/or from other sources).

### Models of a modular furniture system

This theme concerns the development of models of modular furniture systems, for bedroom, office, outdoor, etc.  (e.g. from [IKEA](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/allproducts/)).
A huge number of examples can be found by googling for images of [modular furniture systems](https://www.google.com/search?q=modular+furniture+systems&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=CwyvUcnQLcHKPajXgagL&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&biw=1440&bih=802).
It would be highly appreciated the design of a software system highly modular and with software components directly reproducing the various furniture elements.
An appreciated goal will be the capability of easily assembling the code, in order to reproduce the layout of a user-designed environment.

## Assignment delivery

The project must be contained a directory entitled `final-project`,  
pushed into your repository in cvdlab-cg organization [https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/xxxxxx](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/)  
where `xxxxxx` is your student ID (matricola).

The project must be presented throught some web pages, preferably in English.  
Project's presentation pages can be hosted in [github:pages](http://pages.github.com/).

In these pages student must:

- briefly describe the object of the project;
- explain project's hierarchical decomposition into parts of different levels;
- present the work with systesis images and references to used resources.  

The structure and the graphic quality of the web pages of the project's description will contribute, along with the quality of JavaScript code, and the quality of the implemented details, to the formulation of the final mark.
