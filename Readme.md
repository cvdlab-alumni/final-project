# Final project assignment
**Computational Visual Design Lab ([CVDLab](https://github.com/cvd-lab))**  
**DIA, "Roma Tre" University, Rome, Italy**  
**Computational Graphics 2012**  

# Introduction

Final project is individual and mandatory.  

Project must run on Google Chrome using the platform framework **[Plasm.js](https://github.com/cvdlab/plasm.js)** developed under the course [Computer Graphics](http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~paoluzzi/web/did/graficacomp/2012/).  

Student can choose the project's subject among general themes discussed below.  


## Specific themes

### Models of biosystems

The argument concerns the **3D modeling of biological systems** chosen by the student within folowing human systems: 

- skeletal system
- cardio-circulatory system
- nervous system

The project will investigate the construction of form with transfinite techniques using  solids, surfaces and spline curves of appropriate size and structure.  

The project can refer to [repositories of DICOM images](https://github.com/cvdlab-bio/web3d) and / or graphic images taken from medical atlases.   
An excellent example of this type is provided by the volume *[The Human Body, An Illustrated Guide to Every Part of The Human Body and How it Works](http://us.dk.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780789479884,00.html?strSrchSql=Human+Body/The_Human_Body_Martyn_Page)*, by Martyn Page (Ed.).


### Models of Leonardo's central plan schemes

The project involves the construction of a geometric reconstruction of Leonardo's central plan schemes.   

A collection of images of Leonardo's sketches and / or reconstructions using physical models of Leonardo's central plan schemes can be found in this [archive](http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~paoluzzi/web/did/graficacomp/2010/doc/leonardo.zip).


### Models of Palladian villas

The project involves the construction of **3D models of Palladian villas**.  

This denomination denotes a set of exclusive villas, built in the mid-sixteenth century by Andrea Palladio in the territory of the Republic of Venice and concentrated mostly in the province of Vicenza.  

Thanks also to the detailed drawings published by Palladio in the treatise *I quattro libri dell'architettura* (1570), the Palladian villas have been for centuries an object of study for architects from Europe --- cit. Wikipedia, and are subject of numerous 3D graphics reconstructions.


# Assignment delivery

The project must be contained a directory entitled `final-project`,  
pushed into your repository in cvdlab-cg organization [https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/xxxxxx](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/)  
where `xxxxxx` is your student ID (matricola).

The project must be presented throught some web pages, preferably in English.  
Project's presentation pages can be hosted in [github:pages](http://pages.github.com/).

In these pages student must:

- briefly describe the object of the project;
- explain project's hierarchical decomposition into parts of different levels;
- present the work with systesis images and references to used resources.  

The structure and the graphic quality of the web pages of the project's description will contribute, along with the quality of JavaScript code, and the quality of the implemented details, to the formulation of the final mark.  

The project must be delivered al least two days before verbalization.
